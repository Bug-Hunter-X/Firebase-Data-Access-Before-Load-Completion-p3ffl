The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This is especially common when using asynchronous operations. For example, if you try to get the value of a field immediately after calling `getDoc()` without using a `.then()` or `async/await`, you might encounter undefined or null values which may cause errors further down in your code.
