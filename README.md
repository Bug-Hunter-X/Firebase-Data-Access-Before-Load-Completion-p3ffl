This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` shows the correct way to handle asynchronous operations using promises or async/await to prevent this issue.  Always ensure data is fully loaded before accessing it to avoid runtime exceptions and unexpected behavior.
